# photobrowser
React Native photo browsing demo using [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) as a source for the photos.

## Build and run
Build and run on android by running commands: 
- npm install
- react-native run-android

## Features
The app has the basic features described [here](https://gist.github.com/MPuhakka/20fc01b4e398e29b369122ce7690c61e).

In addition I tried to use ES2017 syntax in code (*async* and *await*).
